FGO has been going on for 3 and a half years and has grown exponentially since it started back in July of 2015. Since then countless Servants have been released, many being harder to get then others. Given how many have been released and with the game obviously going to release more in the near future, I decided to do a bit of cataloging. In this post I have chosen to catalog the total number of playable servants currently in the game, along with their class, rarity and availability. Be warned. 
Welcome to the official r/Bollywood Celebrity Ranking thread! ampnbsp; ampnbsp; Ever thought how posters here in this sub throw about claims and questions like “Ranveer is the next SRK”, “How the hell is Jacqueline Fernandez still getting film roles?” or “Sallu Bhai is d00med”? Well, this thread is an attempt to rank all relevant actors, directors, producers, models, or any other influential individual within the Indian celeb world. ampnbsp; The ranking system is as follow. So as we all know, black or raven coloured hair is truly the best hair, but sadly enough some classes are less represented than others, and I'm here to point out that deficiency for DW to hopefully correct one day. I'm also going to count in darker purple or brown hues. Saber: Gille de Rais edit (can't believe I forgot Saber Shiki) Rating: 2/5 What got me started in the first place. Out of all the Sabers in the game, why do we only have Gilles de Rais as our representative? Truly something. A continuation of my popularity poll, vote only if you didn't on the others. Just post your top five servants, based on gameplay, ascetics, lore, whatever. Then I will add them to the tally. My Favorites 1. Mordred (5 points) 2. Cu Chulainn-Alter (4 points) 3. Karna (3 points) 4. Amakusa Shirou (2 points) 5. Lancelot-Saber (1 point) Master List 1. Mordred-76p 2. Ereshkigal-50p 3. Tamamo no Mae-50p 4. Cu Chulainn-45p 5. Jeanne d'Arc (Alter)-41p 6. Gilgamesh-39p 7. EMIYA-37p 8. Abagail William. So there were about 600 respondents for JP amp NA Part 2. Below I’m going to quickly summarize the top 3 of the various questions, starting with JP, then NA Part 2. Survey was before Brynhildr summoning in NA Note that the Google Results are not here because it was cutting off all of the servant’s names, so you couldn’t tell who got how many responses. The spreadsheets do contain the raw data from the survey, so if you’re concerned about accuracy, you can download the spreadsheet FGO material I Servant Translator :-------- :--------: Mash Kyrielight In Progress by u/Kinalvin Artoria Pendragon ( Translated by King of Padoru Artoria Pendragon (Alter) (https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/8wudrb/artoria_pendragon_alters_servant_profile_from_fgo/) Translated by u/Kinalvin Artoria Pendragon (Lily) (http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/6951-Fat. 
UPDATE: After looking at some of the additional resources posted by u/BayushiKoji and u/Groonzie I decide to go back and make something I personally would find more useful. The format barrows heavily from what u/BayushiKoji posted. Unfortunately the OP isn't listed, so I can't give proper credit. I'll no longer be monitoring this post, so please post comments or corrections to the new post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/8ezrnh/new_and_improved_upcoming_event_servant_bonus_l. # Preface: Update: It seems that I misunderstood when asking around and the current meta isn't pure Arts sustain but a hybrid Buster burst with Arts sustain support. Since there aren't any notable Quick supports on the same level as the current Buster supports, this would make it very difficult for a Quick-NP team to compete unless you have the best servants and CEs of respective categories (even then, someone would have to test it out and do a more in depth damage comparison). So until Not much to say here, I just thought it was about time to set up a megathread to properly compile my Servant dialogue translations. The table of contents will be updated as translations are finished. If there's a Servant you would like me to work on, please feel free to leave a request in the comments. While I won't verbally confirm each request, I guarantee that I do see them all and will be keeping track. Link :-- :-: Saber Artoria Pendragon Translation Artoria Pendragon (Alter.
